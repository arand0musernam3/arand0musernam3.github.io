This is my proposal to a CV / Portfolio website.

## Project analysis
This project has been carefully designed to look modern and simple at the same time, with just an HTML and CSS toolset.

 - **The final user**: The final user would be anyone interested in knowing my learning and professional career: either an employer who is adquiring information or a geek that has landed on my github page.
 
 - **Information architecture**: The basic idea of the project is that it is a two-column based distribution consisting of only one webpage. The former consists of compact and visually appealing information, so that the reader can grasp the skillset and contact information quickly. The latter exposes more details and recognitions that I achieved that a quick passer-by might not find relevant. It is aimed at employers who would want to check the person's background or would explore his or her best projects.
 
 - **Visual design**: The main color of the project is blue. It is said to be associated with [inspiration, wisdom and serenity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_symbolism). Furthermore, the gradient on the background allows the user to feel like he or she is diving into the information as it scrolls down. Moreover, the logos of my career are all formed with different palettes of blue, which perfectly fit with the chosen aesthetic. The font choice is [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto) as it is very clear to read and modern.
 
 ## Inspiration
 I gathered inspiration and resources from the following websites:
  - 
  - 
  
  
## Figma design
First and foremost the whole website was designed with [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) and with icons from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/). 

Here is the link to the Figma project: https://www.figma.com/file/ng4OCPKeJZvLnmtbAXZvHR/CV-(el-bo)-(Copy)?type=design&mode=design&t=MwTrang2MUXayAa9-1

## Project implementation
The project has been implemented following Figma's CSS tips and the use of Flexboxes. The latter allowed the website to be highly adaptative to many resolutions and screen sizes as the objects are allowed to float freely and rearrenge themselves in optimal positions.
